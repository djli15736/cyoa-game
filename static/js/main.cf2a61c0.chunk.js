You don\'t choose when the save point is, but you won\'t be trapped in an infinite death loop. Too expensive? It\'s precognition and immortality, it should be MORE expensive.","Cost":40},{"ID":2,"Name":"Great Sage","Description":"An AI is implanted inside your head. It gives good advice, improves your analytical skills, increases your thinking speed, helps you store memories, etc. Basically, it aids in most aspects of intelligence. Will sass you if you do dumb stuff.","Cost":30},{"ID":3,"Name":"Pandora\'s Actor","Description":"You can shapeshift into anyone or anything you\'ve seen in real life or in images. You don\'t gain any powers from this though, so don\'t expect to breathe fire after transforming into a dragon. You\'re also really good at lying.","Cost":20},{"ID":4,"Name":"Predator","Description":"You can assimilate the abilities and inherent traits of anything you eat. For example, eating a dragon gives you its fire breathing, flight, superhuman durability, etc. You have to actually kill it first though.","Cost":25},{"ID":5,"Name":"Tome of Truth","Description":"State a goal to this tome.

The shield evolves as you get stronger and will gain abilities that will supplement yours in battle, such as giving fire immunity if you go hunting for dragons to eat.","Cost":10},{"ID":7,"Name":"Being X","Description":"I\'ll give a deity in your new world custody over you. You can pray to it for various power ups during battle, and the more you rely on it, the more power you gain over time. However, you also need to keep it happy. Hopefully you don\'t get some trickster god...","Cost":10},{"ID":8,"Name":"Useless Goddess","Description":"You get a companion! She\'s a goddess who\'s also interested in adventure and is willing to support you with buffs, healing, and even resurrection in battle! Cool right? Wrong. She\'s really dumb. REALLY dumb. As in, most of her attempts to help will probably be the reason why you need to be resurrected in the first place. You can make it work right?","Cost":15},{"ID":9,"Name":"Aschente","Description":"Challenge someone to any competition ranging from card games to duels. If they have a chance at beating you, they will always accept. Both of you must agree to certain terms for the winner and loser before the competition begins.
